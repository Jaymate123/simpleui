# Hello!

**Are you tired of Garry's Mods UI? Do you want something cool and edgy to spice things up! Well here's my terribly made addon, which is however a WIP and is being actively developed. I am probably going to change the name to Simple UI because it isn't very good, very basic.**

## You can choose between light or dark mode!

Features:

Derma Reskin

  *This changes the look of the spawnmenu, it's a bit flatter and simpler. If you use ULX, you can choose to change the Derma theme in ULX settings.*

Light & Dark Mode

  *Take your pick! In Spawnmenu (Q) -> Options (top right) -> ModernUI -> Settings you can choose what you want.*

Weapon Selector

  *I admit, it's not very good but its design is much simpler than the default, yellow one.*

Notifications

  *A small but very cute thing. The custom notifications in ModernUI are much nicer :)*

Cute HUD

  *Simple and modern! A simple health and armor bar, that slide and disappear when not needed. There is also a basic ammo display.*

Slightly Nicer Scoreboard

  *Coming soon.*

Performance Enhancements

  *We disable widgets and hooks for performance, and we have a fps boost command. It works the same as most other systems.*
    !enablefpsenhance OR !disablefpsenhance
